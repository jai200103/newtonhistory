              Isaac Newton was the greatest English mathematician of his generation. He laid the foundation for differential and integral calculus. His work on optics and gravitation make him one of the greatest scientists the world has known.

                Here's a time line of Isaac Newton Sr. life:
                <br>
                Isaac Newton's life can be divided into three quite distinct periods. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The first is his boyhood days from 1643 up to his appointment to a chair in 1669.
                    </li><br>

                    <li>
                        The second period from 1669 to 1687 was the highly productive period in which he was Lucasian professor at Cambridge.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                        The third period (nearly as long as the other two combined) saw Newton as a highly paid government official in London with little further interest in mathematical research.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                </ul>
                <p>Isaac Newton was born in the manor house of Woolsthorpe, near Grantham in Lincolnshire. Although by the calendar in use at the time of his birth he was born on Christmas Day 1642, we give the date of 4 January 1643 in this biography which is the "corrected" Gregorian calendar date bringing it into line with our present calendar. (The Gregorian calendar was not adopted in England until 1752.) Isaac Newton came from a family of farmers but never knew his father, also named Isaac Newton, who died in October 1642, three months before his son was born. Although Isaac's father owned property and animals which made him quite a wealthy man, he was completely uneducated and could not sign his own name.</p>
